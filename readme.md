# Cousteau

This project uses node sass to compile the CSS file.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository.

Run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies.

The `~/src/main.scss` file is responsible for customization to Bulma.

Run `npm start` to begin watching changes to `main.scss`.

A working copy of the compiled CSS can be found in `~/dist/cousteau.css`.

You can also run `npm run build` for a one-time build.
